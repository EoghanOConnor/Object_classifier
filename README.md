# Object_classifier
ResNet and DenseNet model for object classification for the CIFAR-10 Dataset<br>
These are deep CNN models. <br>
ResNet is a neural network architecture that uses skip connections to allow gradients to flow more easily during training, <br>
enabling deeper networks to be trained. DenseNet is a neural network architecture that connects all layers directly to each other, <br>
resulting in dense connections that allow information to flow more easily between layers.<br>
